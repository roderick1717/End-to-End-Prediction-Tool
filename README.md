# End-to-End-Prediction-Tool
This repository contains a tool for end-to-end prediction of molecular properties starting from SMILES strings in the AD-HoC system. It automates the process of generating molecular descriptors using quantum chemical calculations and extracting features, followed by predictions using pre-trained machine learning models. The workflow integrates Gaussian for quantum chemical calculations, Multiwfn and RDKit for descriptor extraction, and pre-trained models for final predictions.
